## Goals

Practical goal: students can write a simple smart contract in solidity.

Overarching goal: students have gained insight into the potential of smart contracts and several related blockchain subjects. They know about the application and the why of blockchain.

After this course:

- The student is able to work with the Remix IDE. This includes writing, testing and deploying smart contracts from within Remix.
- The student is able to write and deploy Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum (test) network. For example smart contracts for coins, voting and bets
- The student is able to connect the Remix IDE to Metamask and manage transactions via Metamask.
- The student is able to describe what Ethereum, Solidity, Remix IDE, MetaMask, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Swarm and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are.
