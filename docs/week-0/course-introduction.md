# Decentralized development: course manual

## Course Introduction

In this course you will learn about decentralized development hands on. Through a combination of theory and practical application you will learn how to program code that is deployed on a blockchain through smart contracts.

A basic knowledge about blockchain is assumed. Programming experience is not required.

At the end of this course you will have gained insight into the potential of smart contracts and several related blockchain subjects. You will be able to program smart contracts in Solidity and know about key concepts to make them work (see: [student goals](#student-goals)).

During the course we will use [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity) lessons 'Solidity Path: Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contracts'. Each week (with exception of week 1) we will discuss relevant concepts to the CryptoZobies lesson in class. These coding concepts will be explained using live coding examples in remix ide. In class more general concepts surrounding smart contracts will also be discussed.

All materials can be found on canvas. They include this course manual with a chapter for every week, the final assignment and the powerpoint slides.

## Grading

Your grade for this course will be determined by an assignment which you can find on canvas.

The assignment deadline is **deadline** and **insert handing in method**.

Whether you keep up with the CryptoZombie material will not be checked. CryptoZobie has a hit-system and you can check all the answers yourself. However we do strongly recommend following along with the Crypto lessons. Most of what you need to learn for your final assignment can be learned in those lessons.

## Student goals

After this course:

- The student is able to write Solidity smart contracts and knows how to use concepts like typed variables, functions, events, arrays & mapping, modifiers, etc.
- The student is able to describe security risks and precautions that can be taken with programming smart contract code.
- The student is able to use inheritance and interfaces and is able to describe the purpose of these concepts.
- The student is able to work with the Remix IDE. This includes writing, testing and deploying smart contracts from within Remix.
- The student is able to write and deploy Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum (test) network.
- The student is able to connect the Remix IDE to Metamask and manage transactions via Metamask.
- The student is able to describe what Ethereum, Solidity, Remix IDE, MetaMask, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Swarm are.
