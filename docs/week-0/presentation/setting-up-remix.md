# Decentralized Development

Getting Started with Remix IDE and Solidity

---
# What is Solidity?
> Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
---
# Ok, but what is it really?
- A programming language specifically designed for writing smart-contracts for Ethereum based blockchain networks
- It's compiled to bytecode and executed by the **EVM**

---
# EVM?
- **E**thereum **V**irtual **M**achine
- Ethereum's runtime environment for smart contracts
- Sandboxed and completely isolated, meaning no access to
  - Filesystem
  - Network
  - Other processes

# What is Remix IDE?
A browser-based compiler and IDE that enables users to build Ethereum contracts with Solidity language and to debug transactions.

> Created by Ethereum

---
# Remix IDE allows you to:
- Write Solidity smart-contracts
- Locally test and debug the transactions you write
- Deploy your contracts to a blockchain network
