A group of friends have decided to set up their own personal lottery.

Each month (???) a betting round takes place where they.....
If the bet is not won by anyone, the money put in stays in the smart contract account for the next round.

The friends are planning on this being a long term game and they want to keep track of the rounds they've already played. The rounds played need to be kept track of, anyone (inside or outside of the friend group) should be able to request the round number if they want to check it.

Each participant can transfer money...

...

Several options: loser, winner, avg.

There are some emergency precautions....

Multiple contract files.
.....

The owner of the contract can:

- change ownership
- change the bet amount
