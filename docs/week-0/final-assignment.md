# The Big Betting Contract

For this final assignment you will create a contract to resolve a bet.

A group of friends have decided to set up their own personal lottery.

Each participant can transfer money...

If the bet is not won by anyone, the money put in stays in the account for the next round....

Several options: loser, winner, avg.

There are some emergency precaucions....

Multiple contract files.
.....

The owner of the contract can:

- change ownership
- change the bet amount
- change the amount of participants

Participants can:

-

- ether transfer
- ether withdraw

The friends are planning on this being a long term game and they want to keep track of the rounds. There needs to be a counter that keeps track of the round, everyone should be able to see which round there at.

Extra credit:

Emergency exit: everyone needs to agree and the money gets split.
