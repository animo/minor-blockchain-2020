# Week 1

In the first week we are going to introduce you to some basic concepts of Solidity.

If you have never programmed before it can be very tough to get stated. Especially with Solidity. Solidity has excellent [documentation][solidity documentation] but assumes you have some basic programming experience. That is why we created a [Solidity Cheatsheet]. It is written for people completely new to programming in general, but can even be very helpful if you already have programming knowledge. Also, don't be scared to dive into the [Solidity Documentation] yourself.

See [Truffle Setup] for a step by step explanation on how to setup Truffle.
