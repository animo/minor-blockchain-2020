# An introduction to basic programming concepts.
This document describes common programming concepts that apply to most programming languages out there. It's important to note that the example code given below is **not** valid Solidity code but is meant to give you a general idea of the concepts.


### Variables
In programming, a variable is used to refer or point to a specific place inside of a computers memory. This way, we can store, retreive values without actually refering to the value itself.

Let's have a look at an example

```python
x = 10  # here we assign the number 10 to a variable we'll call x

```


### Functions
#### Constructors
